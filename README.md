Butterfly Species Detection and Classification Using Detectron2
Project Overview
This project aims to automate the detection and classification of butterfly species using Detectron2, a state-of-the-art deep learning framework developed by Facebook AI Research. The solution includes a user-friendly web application built with Flask, enabling real-time identification of butterfly species from images. The project is designed to support biodiversity monitoring, ecological research, and citizen science.

Features
Butterfly Detection: Detect butterflies within images using advanced object detection techniques.
Species Classification: Classify detected butterflies into specific species based on wing patterns and colors.
Real-Time Processing: Web application for instant species identification.
User Interface: Simple and intuitive interface built with Flask for easy image uploads and results display.
