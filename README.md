# ðŸ¦‹ Butterfly Species Detection and Classification Using Detectron2

This project leverages **Detectron2**, a cutting-edge deep learning framework developed by Facebook AI Research, to automate the detection and classification of butterfly species from images. A user-friendly web application built with **Flask** allows for real-time identification of butterfly species, supporting biodiversity monitoring, ecological research, and citizen science initiatives.

## Features

- **Butterfly Detection:** Advanced object detection techniques to detect butterflies within images.
- **Species Classification:** Classify detected butterflies into specific species based on wing patterns and colors.
- **Real-Time Processing:** Web application providing instant identification of butterfly species from uploaded images.
- **User Interface:** Intuitive and simple interface built with Flask, allowing easy image uploads and results display.
